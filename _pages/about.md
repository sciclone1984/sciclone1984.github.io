## Hello!

I'm Alex Sitterer, a Cybersecurity and Networks student at the [University of New Haven](https://www.newhaven.edu) on track to graduate in 2024. I've been interested in cybersecurity since I was in middle school, and through the years I have grown my skills and interests. I have experience in cybersecurity and STEAM fields, which you can learn more about in my [resume](/resume), [portfolio](/portfolio), and [projects](/posts) pages.
