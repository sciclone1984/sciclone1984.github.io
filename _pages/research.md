## Forensicast: A Non-intrusive Approach & Tool for Logical Forensic Acquisition & Analysis of the Google Chromecast TV

**NOTE: This paper was published under my deadname.**

This was the paper I wrote with [Nicholas Dubois](https://www.dragoneyeintel.com/) as a researcher for the Office of Naval Research in college. We looked at the forensic artifacts left on a Chromecast TV, and built a tool to extract and parse them which can be found [here](https://github.com/unhcfreg/ForensiCast).

We also presented this paper at [ARES 2021 (WSDF 2021)](https://2021.ares-conference.eu/), the recording of which you can watch below.
