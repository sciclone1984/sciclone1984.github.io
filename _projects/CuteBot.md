This is a Discord bot I made to send pictures of animals in a Discord channel. It uses the [TinyFox API](https://tinyfox.dev) for the images, and is written in Python. The code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/sciclone1984/CuteBot), and you can add it to your own server [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=969093006512754728&permissions=277025410048&scope=bot%20applications.commands).
