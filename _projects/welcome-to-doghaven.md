I made this game with a few friends for the [University of New Haven's Back to School Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/game-jam-at-university-of-new-haven-8-2022). I did the programming, [skipndots](https://skipndots.itch.io/) did the writing and level design, and [nintenhoe64](https://nintenhoe64.itch.io/) created the music. It's a short horror game made in [bitsy](https://make.bitsy.org/), a small web-based game engine.
