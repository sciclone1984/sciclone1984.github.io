# Alex Sitterer's Personal Website

This is my personal website. If you'd like to check it out, you can visit it [here](https://alexsitterer.com). I use it as a place to put information about me, the things I make, and the stuff i've done. I made it with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).
