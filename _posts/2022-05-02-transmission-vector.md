I made this game as a final project for a college class. In addition to making the game, I created and modeled an [insert](https://social.thangs.com/m/215863) for a Tic-Tac box to hold the project. The unit is self contained and able to host a webserver which serves the game to a player's device. I added decoration to the device so it appeared to be an object actually in the game. The device is made from an Adafruit ESP32-S2, and I followed [this](https://learn.adafruit.com/wordle-personal-esp32-s2-web-server/overview) guide for the firmware set up the webserver.
